in fragment
we do not have setcontentview

we only have inflater like:

	Your class extends Fragment and you have setContentView(R.layout.about_screen);. setContentView is a method of Activity class.

Instead inflate about_screen.xml in onCreateView of Fragment

@Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
        Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    View rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.about_screeen, container, false);
    return rootView;
}


and  if we name like View root = ... ,we have to do root.findViewById
