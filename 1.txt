structured programming to objecte-oriented
	To reduce the cost to maintain a project

c++ is specific pointer( when comes to inheritance if assign sth lagre than the memory arae, it slice and lose sth
also have multiple inheritance

java use non-specific pointer and only single inheritance

static
--------------------------------------
MPost extends Post
Post p
p = new MPost

when static it goes to Post first 
p.getxx() (goes to the Post
but when it runs , it goes to its own class first
system.out.printlin(p.getxx()) ( goes to the MPost
------------------------

interface can only have functions

abstract makes you look down to find a function. An empty class can not because it excutes during the same level.
